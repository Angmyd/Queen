:: PR_PublicHouse
This private home converted to public serving house offers an enjoyable gathering place for seekers of food and beverage. \
Its furnishings are simple but comfortable, and the stove fills the place with the appetizing smells of cooking food. While \
not as diverse in its offerings as the city's taverns, some prefer its more personal charms.
