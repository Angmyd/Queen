::AB_GlutezonShop
This 'shop' is really nothing more than a simple stall with a table, upon which are arranged an assortment \
of goods crafted by the native tribeswomen. Several large baskets are out in the open, their produce practically \
spilling out while what appears to be proper crates, possibly purloined from passing ships, are used as stools \
for customers who want to sit down and enjoy their puchases.
