As you pass the guards, they give you weird looks. Do they see that you are a man? Well, at least they don't try to stop you, \
but you probably should be careful inside. If you get arrested, your fate would probably be worse than that of a woman.

The guards glance at you and return to observing surroundings. Apparently you look just like Cloud District material.

<<else>>
As you attempt to pass the guards, they stop you.

"Hold on! You clearly don't belong there."

Feigning ignorance, you ask why.

"Because it's for the upper class, which means local nobles and wealthy people, and I know all local nobles personally, \
while your appearance is certainly not showing any wealth."

Oh well, not this time.
