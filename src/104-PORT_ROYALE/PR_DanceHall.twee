:: PR_DanceHall
This ballroom is a sordid mirror to the fine ballrooms of the continent. Though its tall, gilded walls and \
elaborate hardwood floors are the equal of their high society counterparts, the atmosphere is decidedly more \
corrupt. Beneath the grandiose arcade windows, crystal chandeliers and marbled columns are sculptured figures \
in explicitly sexual poses and vivid oil paintings of indecent acts. Plainly, this hall is meant to inspire \
much more than dancing.

:: PR_StudyCrowd
You take your time and casually stroll through the crowd, observing the dancers that are working the floor \
and performing, both on stage as well as in semi-secluded 'private' dances. 

After some time, you come to the decision that currently the crowd favors \

go backstage and change before performing.

:: PR_Stage [custom-menu]
You step up to the stage manager and make it known that you'd like to perform. If you have the right level of skill \
and the guts to take the plunge, you can perform a routine and even get paid for it.
