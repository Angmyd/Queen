:: AB_MysteriousLanding
Amid the swamp's bleak, stifling murk, a ramshackle landing perches over the viridian water on tilting piles. Rickety planks run \
the short length of its tread to a tiny islet, where a @@color:gold;'small shanty'@@ has been raised on posts above the water-logged stand.

The shanty's frame is formed by crooked wooden poles, clad in rough-sawn planks and topped by a moss-eaten thatched roof. A narrow, covered \
porch shields the shack's only door, half-buried in vines. The hut's appearance falls somewhere between a man-made dwelling and a natural \
part of the vegetation. The soft glow of a lantern shines through its oiled linen window coverings, the flickering orange cast reflected by \
dozens of glass bottles dangling on strings from nearby trees.
