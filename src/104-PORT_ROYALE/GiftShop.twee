:: GiftShop
A woody, antiquated air fills this quaint @@color:gold;'Curio Shop'@@, which is filled to every corner \
with a menagerie of oddities and needful things. The hodgepodge of sundry uncatalogued items is like a \
thousand stories told all at once, yet all are somehow kept tamed and tidy by the loving hand of the proprietor. \
An array of unusual sounds greets you as well - the ticking of old timepieces, the bells of clockwork curiosities \
and the squawk of a testy blue-gold macaw who perches behind the counter. It is a place of humble wonders, \
brought here from distant shores, collectively inhabiting an eccentric life that surpasses the sum of its parts.
