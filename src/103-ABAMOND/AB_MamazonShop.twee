::AB_MamazonShop
This shop is an open air affair, essentially a large shelter that contains various baskets filled with goods. \
It's obvious that in such a small village that no care is taken to prevent thefts as anyone stupid enough \
to steal would find themselves exiled. A rickety wooden table lays in front of the shelter, it is covered \
in an array of produce, all of it native to the island, and most of it quite rare.
