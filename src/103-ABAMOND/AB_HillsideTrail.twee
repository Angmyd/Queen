::AB_HillsideTrail
The trail winds along the hillside, occasionally providing a picturesque view of lush jungle filled valleys \
and the seaside shore. A large @@color:gold;Overgrown Cairn@@ looms in the distance, the rock outcropping \
jutting into the sky and covered with vines, while in the opposite direction lays the path to the \
@@color:gold;Hillside Plateu@@.
