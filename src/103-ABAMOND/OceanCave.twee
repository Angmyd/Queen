:: OceanCave
You recall hearing hushed discussions about these caves. Evidently they have been used in times past by various freebooters and pirates \
as both a refuge as well as a place to store their ill gotten gains. This makes sense as these caves are set far enough back from the beach \
that even at the high tide they still do not completely flood. The air is damp and salty and other than the occasional wall covered with \
lichen you don't see any signs of life.

<<if setup.player.Phase > 1>>It's too late in the day to explore, but perhaps if you came back in the morning?<<else>>\
A brief look around the area has led to the discovery of multiple passages that lead deeper. It's early enough in the day that you \
could explore them if you wanted to.<</if>>
