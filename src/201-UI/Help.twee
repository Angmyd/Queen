<div class='HeaderSection' style='background-color:indigo'>Player Attributes</div>
Player attributes are divided into three main categories - @@color:maroon;Statistics@@, @@color:steelblue;Body@@ \
and @@color:seagreen;Skills@@. They can be developed in \
many different ways, such as through training, magic, chemistry, or just random chance. There are two components \
that make up every attribute, it's ''Score'' and it's ''XP''. ''XP'', either positive or negative will adjust an \
attribute if accumulated sufficiently.

<div class='HeaderSection' style='background-color:maroon'>Statistics</div>
Statistics are typically increased by use, although certain magical affects can increase or decrease them.
* ''Health'' - How much damage you can take before death.
* ''Energy'' - A measure of how many actions you can take before being exhausted.
* ''Willpower'' - Your mental fortitude. If this drops too low, you lose the game.
* ''Perversion'' - Affects how you react to certain activities. Can protect from some ''Willpower'' losses.
* ''Nutrition'' - How well fed you are. If this drops too low, you'll starve. Also influences healing.
* ''Femininity'' - How feminine you are in mannerisms.
* ''Toxicity'' - How toxic your blood is. Very high levels can retard healing, or even kill you.
* ''Hormones'' - A scale between masculine and feminine. So long as you have testes, you will slowly shift male.
Finally, there is a 'hidden' attribute called ''Fitness'' that increases with physical activity and decreases if \
you are lazy. It plays a factor in how much ''Energy'' and ''Health'' you recover overnight.

<div class='HeaderSection' style='background-color:steelblue'>Body</div>
A big part of this game is experimenting with the effects various foods, potions and drugs have on your \
players body. You can see a description of most changes by observing yourself in a mirror in your @@color:gold;Cabin@@ \
and if you have the ''Avatar'' turned on from the ''Settings'' menu then you will see a 2D rendering of those \
changes as well as whatever clothing you happen to be wearing.

Here are a few major points:
* ''Hormones'' - Can induce a physical change towards either feminine or masculine attributes, but there is a limit.
* ''Food'' - Most food that isn't marked as ''Wholesome'' has a transformation effect on you. 
* ''Potions'' - There are several potions that give multiple transformations.
* ''Duration'' - All changes are permenant unless undone by some other factor. They typically happen overnight and you \
will be able to observe them through the log that gets displayed when you ''Sleep''

<div class='HeaderSection' style='background-color:seagreen'>Skills</div>
Skills are gained through either being taught them, or through practice. When you perform an action that \
involves a skill, the quality of that action gets determined and the result you get is based on that figure. \
You typically do not have entire 'pass' or 'fail' states for most skill usages, but they do exist. 

Using a skill will give ''XP'' and that XP can be processed either when you are ''Resting'' or ''Sleeping'' \
for material gains in points. You can observe all your skills from the ''Skills'' panel link in the side bar.
* ''Swashbuckling'' - The art of fighting like a pirate. Good for both offense and defense.
* ''Sailing'' - The main skill required to be a competent Helmsman.
* ''Navigation'' - Helps prevent you from being lost and aids in exploring.
* ''Seduction'' - Aids you in arousing targets and convincing them to do what you want.
* ''Singing'' - Everyone enjoys a good sea-shanty. "Yo, ho, yo ho, a Pirates life for Me."
* ''Dancing'' - Includes exotic dancing. Good dancers are also fast on their feet, which can be handy.
* ''Cleaning'' - Hey, someone has to do it.
* ''Cooking'' - The ability to make delicious meals.
* ''Serving'' - Customer service. Can affect things like pay or tips for certain jobs.
In addition to the above, there are also the sex skills, ''Hand Jobs'', ''Blow Jobs'', ''Tit Fucking'' and \
''Ass Fucking''. Since you're playing this game, we'll assume you know what they are. There may be other, hidden, \
skills that you can learn or find.

<div class='HeaderSection' style='background-color:hotpink'>Whoring</div>
This is the primary way to earn money on the @@color:cyan;Salty Mermaid@@, but it can also be employed at \
various other locations in the world. The act itself is largely abstracted into a simple slot machine \
interface that simulates your somewhat 'less than enthusiastic' attitude towards your new rank in life. You start \
out the game with three slot reels unlocked and some beginner slots that you can equip from your ''Skills'' \
panel. The first time you attempt to Whore, a small tutorial page will appear.

While playing the game you can complete quests that will grant you either additional unlocks of slot reels, or \
the reels themselves. This simulates how you slowly start to accept your whoring lifestyle. Eventually when \
you have all of your slots unlocked and filled, you will be churning through customers like a super slut and \
raking in the doubloons. 

A word of caution though - It is very easy to lose ''Willpower'' through whoring. Having a high ''Perversion'' \
stat will help minimize this.

<div class='HeaderSection' style='background-color:crimson'>Combat</div>
The world is not a very safe place, as your current predicament shows. It will occasionally be required that \
you either fight, or flee from various enemies that wish to do you harm. This is where combat comes in. The \
key attributes of combat are:
* ''Stamina'' - Consumed to perform attacks.
* ''Combo'' - Can be generated by using attacks in the right sequence. Consumed by some attacks.
* ''Style'' - Can be selected and changed at any time in the UI. Not all styles are allowed during all fights.
* ''Attack'' - Hidden statistic, governed by skill style being used.
* ''Defense'' - Hidden statistic, governed by the skill style being used.
* ''Status Effects'' - Certain attacks can grant you buffs, or debuff your enemies.
By default, there are two main modes of fighting available to your character:
* ''Unarmed'' - Damage is determined by ''Fitness''. Having a high ''Dancing'' skill can aid in defense.
* ''Swashbuckling'' - Damage is determined by weapon quality, success in attack and defense is from the skill.
In addition to the above, there may be other combat techniques that you can learn. There are also some \
moves that are common to all styles:
* ''Restore Stamina'' - Converts 1 point of ''Energy'' into a full bar of ''Stamina''.
* ''Defend'' - A very fast combat move that grants you a defense buff and gives you a small bit of ''Stamina''.
* ''Flee'' - Not available in all fights. If succesfull, you flee from combat.
As a player character, you have the ability to consume items in combat whenever you want. This is a huge \
advantage and you should make liberal use of it. A final @@color:maroon;word of warning@@ - Not all fights \
will be fatal, but many of them are. Always expect the worst.

<div class='HeaderSection' style='background-color:orangered'>Healing and Recovery</div>
During the course of your adventure, you will become seriously fucked up at one point or another and in danger \
of dying, or worse, losing your mind and becoming a sissy fuckslut for the rest of your life. Typically, \
''Resting'' or ''Sleeping'' will recover your ''Health'' and ''Energy'' while lowering your ''Toxicity'', but \
recovering ''Willpower'' is much harder. Here are a few useful tips:
* Resting all day can stockpile energy which is useful for when you want to do an action like whoring, or fighting.
* Resting also can cause you to process skill gains faster than just sleeping.
* Both Resting and Sleeping can heal you, gain energy and reduce your Toxicity.
* Generally, Nutrition and Fitness play a big role in Energy and Health recovery.
* Some consumable items can help you slowly recovery Willpower, make sure to pay attention to any knowledge gained.
* Raising your Perversion very high can help insulate you from a lot of Willpower losses. Join the dark side.
While managing your Health is relatively easy to understand, @@color:maroon;be warned@@ that you will also lose \
the game if your WillPower ever drops below 20% (2 stars). When in doubt, hit the hard liquer and pray.
