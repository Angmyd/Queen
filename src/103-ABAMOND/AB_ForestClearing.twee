::AB_ForestClearing
The wind blows strongly in this clearing, situated next to a small stream and a deep @@color:gold;Forest Trail@@. \
From here you can see a @@color:gold;Small Village@@ built to the north, faint wafts of smoke coming from either \
campfires or chimneys, you can't tell. The path leading in that direction is well taken care of though, which leads \
you to believe that the area sees frequent travel.
