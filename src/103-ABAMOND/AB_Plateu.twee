::AB_Plateu
This hillside plateu overlooks the @@color:gold;Hidden Cove@@ on one side and the expanse of jungle on the \
other. From this vantage point you can make out what appears to be dotted stone structures in the foilage \
below, perhaps the remains of some ancient civilization? 

The hill is rocky and sparesely covered with giant palm trees and bushes. Off in one direction is a well worn \
@@color:gold;Hillside Trail@@ leading deeper into the rugged terrain, while in the opposite direction is a \
@@color:gold;Forest Trail@@ leading to a deep copse of trees.
