::AB_ForestTrail
Travelling along this trail, it doesn't take long before the forest starts to encroach all around you. Even with \
carefully watching your path you still end up pushing aside numerous overgrown plants and vines. The sounds of \
the rainforest are especially vibrant here, the unfamiliar calls of exotic birds echoing through the tall \
tree tops.
