:: HighHill
The stunning @@color:gold;High Hill District@@ gets its name from the loft purchase it has over the whole of @@color:gold;Golden Isle@@. \
Up here, behind the barricaded walls, both thrill seeking nobles and errant Pirate Captains rub shoulders in pursuit of revelry and \
fortune. Unlike the lower @@color:gold;Portside@@ district, the broad thoroughfares here are both well maintained and regularly \
patrolled. The villas that dot the winding road up to the @@color:gold;Governor's Mansion@@ are richly appointed and neat. If you didn't \
know better you'd think you were in a quaint provincial town, and not a den of rogues and pirates.
