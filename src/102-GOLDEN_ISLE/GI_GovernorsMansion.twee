:: GI_GovernorsMansion
Prior to the island falling into Pirate hands, This beautiful baroque ch√¢teau was once the official palace and home of the crown's appointed governor. It was as much a representation \
of the power of the monarch as it is a residence, and as such is built to the highest possible standard. Spacious and aristocratic, it silently \
projects authority and importance from the highest perch on the Golden Isle.

Visitors arrive by way of a dramatic, circular carriageway. This places them in a vantage point that emphasizes and enhances the mansion's sweeping grandeur. \
A manicured yard borders the passage. Closer in, vividly-flowered bougainvillea hedges channel arrivals into the building's arrival courtyard.

Once in the courtyard, the estate itself is easily viewed in detail. It has a facade composed of three stories, each theatrically united by \
high pilasters and mirrored exterior staircases, flanked by classic architectural figure statues. The vermilion color of the manor's terra cotta \
roof is carried through in painted columns and pedimented windows, creating a stately contrast across the structure. The entry stoop is a climb of two \
flights of stairs, reminding callers of their place.

As you approach the entrance to the @@color:gold;Governor's Mansion@@ a huge giant of a man stop you.

@@color:cyan;Uticus@@ says, <span class="npcText">"Oi yee can't be entering there without my say so!"</span>

You take one look at his giant frame and equally impressive cutlass and decide that proceeding would be a \
very unwise idea.\

<span class="npcText">"Hey @@color:deepPink;<<= setup.player.SlaveName >>@@, if you want to be entering \

<span class="npcText">"Hey @@color:deepPink;<<= setup.player.SlaveName >>@@, why don't you come back \
later and we'll have another round o' it? Maybe then I'll be satisified enough with your whore ass to \

It seems that @@color:cyan;Uticus@@ won't be satisified with just a fuck or two, you'll have to keep letting \
him molest you with his monsterous black cock until he says he's had enough.
