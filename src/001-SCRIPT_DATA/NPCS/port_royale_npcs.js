        "Title": "NPC_NAME Littlehales, Bar Wench",
        "LongDesc": "NPC_NAME is an older, but still attractive woman, with long flowing black hair and a truly stupendous bust that is only enhanced by her corseted dress. She can usually be found busily tending to orders, or just casually chatting up a regular.",

        "LongDesc": "For a woman in her 40s, NPC_NAME clearly lives up to her nickname of 'Sultry'. She has a fine, voluptuous figure with heaving breasts and a pronounced arse, both of which are barely contained by her flimsy evening gown.

    "DailyLust": 10,
    "Title": "NPC_NAME, Gentleman Buccaneer",
    "LongDesc": "At first glance, this \"Gentleman Buccaneer\" might be mistaken for a highly-ranked noble, though in fact he was a successful privateer, and is now a man of leisure. His attire is meant to display his conspicuous wealth: On his shoulders is a fine, black frock coat with braided lace facings, ornate gold buttons, and generous dog-ear sleeve cuffs fit for a commodore. Beneath his coat are an intricate brocade set of waistcoat and breeches, white stockings, and polished, heeled court shoes. On his head is worn a magisterial, powdered wig that flows below his shoulders, complemented by a dashing, lace-edged cravat under his collar. Lest anyone forget how his wealth was earned, he wears a keen-edged rapier, whose engraved brass basket hilt incorporates scenes from his storied adventures at sea, and a black dragoon pistol, kept close at hand by a belt hook."

    "DailyLust": 10,
    "Title": "NPC_NAME, Tavern Master",
    "LongDesc": "A lean but sturdily framed man, he has the look of one who has seen it all and lived to tell the tale. His powdered, salt-and-pepper natural hair grows to his shoulders, and he sweeps it back by means of a leather cord. His no-nonsense attire is modestly fashionable, but he has the weather-beaten hands and rolling gait of a veteran sea-dog. His lively, colorful manner is well-suited to publican life, and he runs his ordinary with an accomplished hand. Few can best him at filling - or draining - a tankard."

    "DailyLust": 10,
    "Title": "NPC_NAME, Mistress of the House",
    "LongDesc": "Her lightly rouged, creamy complected face is framed by ringleted onyx locks. Their long curls are stylishly trussed above her head by a ribbon the color of wine splashed with ruby adornments. Her hair spills down to her back and shoulders with precisely careless, spiraling drops. She wears a sangria-hued, mantua gown in shimmering silk with black floral brocade. Its skirts brush the floor and conceal her lower half. Though her dress omits the large hoops so fashionable among high-born ladies, her narrow, corseted waist cuts a mesmerizing, wasp-like figure. Her invisible steps have little rise or fall, creating the illusion that she simply floats across the room as she sees to patrons of the house."
