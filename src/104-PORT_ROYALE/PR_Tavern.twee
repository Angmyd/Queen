:: PR_Tavern
The @@color:gold;'Grey Peacock'@@ is one of the more popular taverns in @@color:gold;'Port Royale'@@, well known for both its wholesome food and \
stiff drinks. The clientele tends to be a step up from the common rabble that you'd find in other places since the @@color:gold;'Great Market'@@ \
is so close by. The interior of the tavern is warm and a little homey, with the distinct scent of island grown tobacco wafting through the air, \
punctuated by scattered conversations and the occasional bark of laughter.
