Through the rear gate of the village lies a twisting trail that winds down the hillside and \
into a small, secluded valley. The land here has been cultivated, with a primative fence surrounding it to \
keep away some of the smaller animals on the island. There are no guards posted here as the natural terrain \
makes the only easily accessible path here directly through the @@color:gold;Mamazon Village@@.
