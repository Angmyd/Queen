:: GI_Jail
The Gaol of @@color:gold;'Golden Isle'@@ is one of the oldest buildings on the island, the former governor having put a premium on trying to maintain \
law and order among the constant stream of traders and sailors that visited these shores. However, it hasn't seen much use since @@color:cyan;'Black Bertie'@@ has taken over. \
