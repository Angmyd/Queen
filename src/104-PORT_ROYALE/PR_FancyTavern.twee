:: PR_FancyTavern
The @@color:gold;'Green Gryphon'@@ is one of the older and more illustrious taverns on the island. It's position in the heart of the \
@@color:gold;'Entertainment District'@@ means that it sees a healthy trade in both pleasure seekers as well as wealthy locals. The \
building itself is three stories tall, with the main floor being reserved for dining and drinking and the upper floors containing \
a series of suites for the more well to do travellers staying in town. The wholesome scent of freshly cooked food and the clatter of \
plates and glasses is comforting after so long at sea.
