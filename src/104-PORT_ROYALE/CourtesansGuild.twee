:: CourtesansGuild
This converted manor house is the past residence of some unfortunate high official, who happened to serve the \
wrong monarch when Port Royale changed hands. Now, this large estate educates young ladies in the finer points \
of social graces, worldly knowledge and feminine wiles, in the future service of wealthy benefactors.

Styled in the manner of the great courtly houses, every room of the school has been paid lavish attention. No \
expense was spared to provision it with every fashionable feature and comfort. This was done with purpose - so the \
trappings of high society become nothing but a pleasant backdrop to the arts of courtisanerie.

Though often judged by moral authorities and the subject of scandal in polite circles, a lady that attends \
Selene's becomes far more than a mere prostitute. She masters not only seduction, but gains the ability to \
engage her future companion in every way, using her wit, charm and intellect alike. As a kept mistress of an \
elite socialite, she can advance to an otherwise unobtainable life of privilege. If played well, she might even \
ascend to powerful financial and social influence.
