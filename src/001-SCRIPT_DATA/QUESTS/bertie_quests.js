    NPC_NAME, the infamous <span style='color:hotpink'>Pirate Queen of the Seas</span> stands before you, resplendant \
    in fine silk and gold. Only the plain cutless hanging from her bejeweled belt hints at her lethality. She eyes you \
    as you approach and then bursts into laughter!\n\n\
    s(What, is this <span style='color:cyan'>Uticus's</span> idea of a joke or something?) she snickers. s(I told that dumb \
    ape I was looking for a consort, not some random tartlet that <span style='color:cyan'>Simone</span> could send up \
    here on her own!).\n\n\
    Wait, what? Did she just say she was //looking// for a mistress? Sexual orientation aside, doesn't that also mean that \
    you just let that black bastard rape your asshole for hours on end for ''no good reason''? \n\n\

    and guiding your eyes to hers, then slowly drawing that same digit down to your collar and giving it a cheeky tug.\n\n\

    last part of that sentance, clearly it's some joke that you don't understand.\n\n\
    s(Listen here strumpet, you need some work, and I'm not just talking about the obvious.) she releases you and steps \
    back to take a seat on a nearby divan. s(You see, when you're as rich and powerful and famous and beautiful as me, \
    society has certain expectations of you and one of those expectations is not to be scene with stupid ugly whores as \
    companions.)\n\n\
    You probably shouldn't feel as attacked as you do, it's not like you ''want'' to be a whore, so being belittled \
    that way shouldn't bother you... right?\n\n\

    we say.... totally //unsympathetic// to your obvious situation.)\n\n\
    You're about to launch into an explanation, describing your captivity, but NPC_NAME silences you with an upraised \
    hand. s(No need to explain, I can guess as much and as I said, I'm not totally berift of sympathy for your plight.) \
    a wry smile forms on her mouth. s(Do something about your looks and get a little class and I might consider \
    giving you a launch or two up the old booty bay. Just don't say I didn't warn you.)\n\n\
    You're not //entirely// sure what NPC_NAME is inferring, but you get the general gist of it. If you want to \
