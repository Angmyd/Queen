::AB_GlutezonGate
You stand before a large, sturdy barricade made out of cleverly masoned boulders. Patches of moss and other \
vegetable matter fill the cracks while some sections have been reinforced with dirt. The wall itself appears \
to seperate the valley from a larger settlement beyond and has a single central gate to control access to \
whatever lies beyond. On top of the wall is a pair of dark haired women, both \
of them are armed with bows and have absolutely enormous asses. 

One of them calls out to you, <span class='npcText'>"Who dares approach the village of the \
<span style='color:cyan'>Glutezons</span>?"</span>

You try to approach the gate but are stopped by an arrow plunging into the ground infront of you!

<span class='npcText'>"Halt! We won't allow any allies of the <span style='color:cyan'>Mamazons</span> \

It seems like you've burned your bridges with the @@color:cyan;Glutezons@@.

It seems like you've encountered the fabled @@color:cyan;Glutezons@@, a tribe of jungle women with immense \
asses. Perhaps if you were equally as endowed they might allow you to enter their village...
