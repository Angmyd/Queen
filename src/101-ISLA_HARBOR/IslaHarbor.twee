:: IslaHarbor
You are standing on the docks of Isla Harbor, your home town. There is a motley collection of sailors \
ambling around loading and unloading ships while occasionally visiting a local @@color:gold;'Tavern'@@. \
Off in the distance, up the hill, you can see the familiar sight of the @@color:gold;'Town Square'@@.
