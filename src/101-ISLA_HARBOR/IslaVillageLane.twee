:: IslaVillageLane
This tree lined lane leads to the fertile farmlands south of the village proper. Every now and then you will pass \
the small wooden home of one of your former neighbors, or a familiar landmark from your child hood. Given what \
has happened to you recently, the feeling is rather nostalgic. Your own family home lays in the direction of \
the @@color:gold;'Farmlands'@@, while the @@color:gold;'Town Square'@@ is generally bustling with activity to the north.
