You wake up in the morning to the firing of cannons and sounds of screaming! In a daze, you lurch out of your \
bed and stumble towards the door of your cabin and out onto the deck. The ship lurches to the left, then to \
the right and you almost tumble to the floor, only to be swept away by a crashing wave over the ships bow that \
sends you flying towards the helm.

The combination of the cold sea water and your own adrenaline quickly clear the fog from your mind. All around you \
is a scene straight from the depths of hell - the crew is engaged in a mortal battle with a Kraken, a create of legend! 

A giant tentacle flies over your head, catching a pirate in the back and sending him flying, his cutlass flying from \
his hands and landing precariously close to your head. 

This looks dangerous, what should you do?
