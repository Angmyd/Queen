:: GFWardrobe
<<set _QE = window.App.QuestEngine>>\

You are standing infront of a beautiful mahogany wardrobe. It's rich, dark-varnished color is accentuated with burnished brass and inlaid ivory accents. It's worth more than you are! But then again, you're very cheap these days, aren't you?
<<if _QE.QuestCompleted($Player, "GFWARDROBE") == false>>
<<set $irr = random(991,1009) >>\
Opening the door, you find some interesting items...

&bull; a super short pink gingham dress
&bull; a pair of white knee socks
&bull; @@color:purple;a 14 inch purple dildo@@
&bull; @@color:purple;a portfolio of pornographic drawings@@
&bull; @@color:gold;<<print $irr >> gold coins@@

You scratch your head. What are these awful, vulgar things doing in darling sweet @@color:pink;<<= $Player.GirlfriendName >>@@'s wardrobe? A blushing maiden like her -- or at least like she //used// to be -- wouldn't have any interest in these filthy drawings much less a dildo of such preposterous length and girth!

Despite the onset of a rather sudden stomachache, you shake your head against the worrisome thoughts and gather the items from the wardrobe.
