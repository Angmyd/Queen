        have to do something for me in return... You see I have a barracks full of horny bastards that \
        aren't getting paid enough to afford a proper whore. You help them out and I'll help you out. \

        that's saying something since I don't usually go for 'girls' like yourself. Anyway, I'll uphold my \
        part of the deal. You're free to come and go as you please, but I warn ye - make any trouble and \
        it's off to the gaol for you.)\n\n\
