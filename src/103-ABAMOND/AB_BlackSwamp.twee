:: AB_BlackSwamp
The twisted roots of mangrove trees dip into the dim, rot-filled marshes around you. The rank odor of algae-filled, stagnant \
water assaults the nose and chokes the breath. Eerie calls of strange, swamp-dwelling animals echo from the interior, while \
the surface of the putrid water sporadically ripples with the passage of submerged amphibian predators. Dry land passages are \
scarce here, and sucking mud and tangled vegetation frustrate every conceivable route in between.
