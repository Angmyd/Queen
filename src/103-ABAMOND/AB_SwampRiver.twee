:: AB_SwampRiver
Dark, languid waters wind their way through the swamp, the rank atmosphere around them immersing the river in a shroud of \
perpetual fog. The murky stream drifts slowly into the primordial wilds, passing the spectral silhouettes of gnarled trees \
and claw-like ferns. From every direction, the sounds of unseen fauna fill the gloom with their discordant song. The swamp \
spawns a powerful sense of being watched by invisible, lurking entities somewhere in the wood.
