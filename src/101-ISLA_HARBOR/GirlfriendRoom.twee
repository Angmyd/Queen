It looks like @@color:HotPink;<<=_GFN>>'s@@ room hasn't been disturb since the night of your ill-fated departure. In fact, the room is practically immaculate as if not a single spec of dust has landed since. @@color:HotPink;<<=_GFN>>@@ always seemed to have particularly girly tastes and her room reflects this. Everything is colored a light rose and draped in voluminus fabrics.
