:: AB_SwampClearing
Following the directions that @@color:cyan;Papa Baba@@ gave you, you eventually happen upon a small copse of trees towards \
the southern end of the swamp. The air here feels... odd. There is an unnatural pressure surrounding you that makes even \
breathing seem laborious. The normal sounds of the swamp are gone and the only thing you can hear is a deep 'thrumming' sound \
that comes from one particular tree.
