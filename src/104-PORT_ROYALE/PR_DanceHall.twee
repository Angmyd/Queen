:: PR_DanceHall
This ballroom is a sordid mirror to the fine ballrooms of the continent. Though its tall, gilded walls and elaborate hardwood \
floors are the equal of their high society counterparts, the atmosphere is decidedly more corrupt. Beneath the grandiose \
arcade windows, crystal chandeliers and marbled columns are sculptured figures in explicitly sexual poses and vivid oil \
paintings of indecent acts. Plainly, this hall is meant to inspire much more than dancing.
