:: PR_DarkAlley
Narrow enough to be missed by most passers-by, this alleyway ends in a dark cul-de-sac shadowed by the projecting upper floors \
of neighboring edifices. Here, amid the crumbling plaster and brick, a set of secretive stairs rise to a doorway. Above it hangs a \
wooden shingle painted with a radiate sun, split by a horizon, that beckons only to the adventurous or well-informed.
