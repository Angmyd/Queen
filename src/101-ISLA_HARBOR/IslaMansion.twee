The Governor's Mansion is the largest and most elegant building on Isla Harbor. You've only been in a few times, mostly when @@color:HotPink;<<-setup.player.GirlfriendName>>@@ would sneak you past the house staff, but it's largely how you remember it: high vaulted ceilings, dark wood panelling, and lush carpets covering the tiled floors.

The Governor himself isn't much for such opulance, but as @@color:HotPink;<<-setup.player.GirlfriendName>>@@ explained to you, there's a certain level of extravagance that's expected with such a prestigous position in society.
