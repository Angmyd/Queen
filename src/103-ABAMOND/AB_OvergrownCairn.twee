::AB_OvergrownCairn
The jungle is more dense here as the hills even out into flatter terrain. There is a giant cairn of \
piled rocks here, specifically two large mounds nestled together and overgrown with foilage and vines. \
You don't know if they have any special significance, but their mere presence has put you on alert and \
makes you desire to move along.

A winding @@color:gold;Hillside Trail@@ leads away from here, back towards the @@color:gold;Hidden Cove@@, \
while a series of rocky steps leads down into the valley below.
