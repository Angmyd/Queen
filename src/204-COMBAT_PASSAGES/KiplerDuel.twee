Your last blow sends @@color:cyan;Kipler@@ sprawling to the deck, the crowd going so silent that you can swear \
the only sounds are the sea and your heartbeat. Everyone, including the First Mate himself, seems to be amazed \
at what you've managed to do. There is a pregnant pause, and then a cheer goes up from the crew. Even \
@@color:cyan;Kipler@@ himself cracks a grin.

The black giant picks himself up off the deck and heads back towards the helm, beckoning you to follow.

You slowly open your eyes and stare at the ceiling of your cabin. Somehow, someone, must have hauled your sissy \
ass back in here after your defeat by the fearsome First Mate of the @@color:cyan;Salty Mermaid@@. You try to \
rise to your feet, but stumble instead to the floor. 

Where did you put those medicinal herbs?
