::LevantBoobpireEvent [no-teleport no-saving]
As you leave <span style='color:gold'>Le Maison Du Soleil Levant</span>, the moon hangs high in the sky, \
casting long shadows in the otherwise dark alley. Something about your encounter with \
<span style='color:cyan'>Solenn Lecl√®re</span> has unsettled you greatly and you wish nothing more than \
to depart as fast as you can.\n\n\
You make it to the end of the alley before you find yourself cut off. A woman with dark features, her head \
covered in a hood approaches you from a hidden corner. In the dim light you can make out that her body is \
thin, but voluptuous with a generous heaving bosom that wobbles slightly as she walks. Instinctively you \
take a step back and the woman lunges, throwing back her hood to reveal a generous amount of snow white \
cleavage and a pair of blood red lips encircling a pair of dazzlingly white fangs!
