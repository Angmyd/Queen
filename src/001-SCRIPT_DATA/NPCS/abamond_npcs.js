    "Title": "NPC_NAME Houngan",
    "LongDesc": "This lean, dusky voodoo priest is dressed in a threadbare black coat with stained, off-white breeches and shoeless feet. On his head is an old capotain hat adorned with a spray of feathers and a crudely-painted death's head. He also wears a necklace of alternating beads and crocodile teeth, a hemp cord bracelet with a carved, wooden charm, and an ivory-colored sash tied around his waist. His solemn stare is slightly unsettling, his eyes distant as if he is seeing the spirit and material worlds all at once."
